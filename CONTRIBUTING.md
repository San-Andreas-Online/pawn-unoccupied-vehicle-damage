On Windows:

```bat
cd %userprofile%\Documents\Projects\pawn-unoccupied-vehicle-damage\
```

On Linux:

```bash
cd ~/pawn-unoccupied-vehicle-damage/
```

Clone via SSH:  

```bash
git clone git@github.com:San-Andreas-Online/pawn-unoccupied-vehicle-damage.git
```

Clone via HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/San-Andreas-Online/pawn-unoccupied-vehicle-damage.git

## Project Conventions

### Versioning

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The version number is composed of three parts: major, minor, and patch. The version number is incremented according to the following rules:

- Major: making all related apps in previous versions incompatible with the current version
- Minor: added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
- Patch: backwards-compatible bug fixes

Generally, versions must be incremented according to the following rules:

- breaking change: +1.0.0
- new feature: +0.1.0
- bug fix: +0.0.1
- other (refactor, indentation, ...): +0.0.01

### Git

⚠️ **Warning**: Always test your code and try to remove errors/warnings before commiting and/or submitting a pull request.  

- Commits should clearly describe their content and remain short. The commit message should be in English and include both the type of commit and the scope of the changes. If the change is global or not related to a specific feature/place in the code, the scope is optionnal.  
  ⚠️If the changes are related to an issue, the scope **must** be the issue number.
  - [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
    - `feat(scope)`: new feature (e.g., *feat(#1): authentication*)
    - `fix(scope)`: bug fix (e.g., *fix(#2): fixed communication problem regarding login*)
    - `docs(scope)`: documentation (e.g., *docs(#3): updated README*)
    - `style(scope)`: changes that do not affect the code (spacing, formatting, etc.) (e.g., *style: fixed indentation*)
    - `refactor(scope)`: code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (e.g., *refactor(#5): optimized code*)
    - `perf(scope)`: performance improvement (e.g., *perf(#6): improved speed*)
    - `test(scope)`: adding or modifying tests (e.g., *test(#7): added unit tests*)
    - `conf(scope)`: build configuration changes (e.g., *conf(#8): updated Dockerfile*)
    - `chore(scope)`: changes to the development environment or project organization (e.g., *chore(#9): updated .gitignore*)
- Every branch must be associated with one type of change (see below) and be created from the `develop` branch. Everytime you finish changes on a branch, you must have it reviewed and merged back into `develop` so that the branch can be deleted and the changes can be integrated into the project. When enough features are ready, it is then possible to merge `develop` into `release/x.x.x` depending on the version number, then make small changes on the release branch in case of bugs, and finally merge the release branch into `main` to deploy the changes.
  - [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
    - `feat/xxxx-name-of-the-feature`: New feature referenced by the issue number and a short description (e.g., `feat/1-authentication`)
    - `fix/xxxx-name-of-the-fix`: Bug fix referenced by the issue number and a short description (e.g., `fix/2-login-error`)
    - `docs/xxxx-name-of-the-docs`: Documentation referenced by the issue number and a short description (e.g., `docs/3-readme`)
    - `style/xxxx-name-of-the-style`: Style changes referenced by the issue number and a short description (e.g., `style/4-indentation`)
    - `refactor/xxxx-name-of-the-refactor`: Refactoring referenced by the issue number and a short description (e.g., `refactor/5-optimization`)
    - `perf/xxxx-name-of-the-perf`: Performance improvement referenced by the issue number and a short description (e.g., `perf/6-speed`)
    - `test/xxxx-name-of-the-test`: Test changes referenced by the issue number and a short description (e.g., `test/7-unit`)

### Code

#### Indentation

Indentation must be done with tabs and not spaces.  
Make sure to follow the indentation established by previous users in the files you modify.

#### Code Quality

- Use LF line endings
- Your code must be as modulable and easily reusable as possible.
- Files should be grouped into a folder hierarchy according to their role
- Your code must be as self-explanatory as possible. If you cannot find a way to make it so, comment "why" and not "how" you did it
- Explicitly name variables and functions (which should remain short) to avoid the need for comments
- File, folder, variable names, and code in general must be in English
- Comments must be in English
- Variables and functions must follow the conventions of their respective language
  - Pawn:
    - Functions: `PascalCase`
    - Variables:
      - Constants: `UPPERCASE`
      - Regular variables: `snake_case`
